<h2>Sunwoo Hoon</h2>
<p>Sunwoo Hoon debuted as a webtoon artist with his work Damage Over Time on the South Korean web portal Daum. In 2015, he won the Emerging Artist Award from the Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival (SICAF). That same year he won the best cartoon/animation critique award from the webzine critic M. Sunwoo Hoon is an active critic in the world of cartoons. Damage Over Time describes the survival story of an individual in a closed, cliquish Korean military camp. Sunwoo Hoon places isolated military troops in an environment rife with zombies, depicting the collective military lives of young South Korean men in an extreme way. In terms of form, he appropriated the quarter view (isometric view) and dot graphics used in computer games. The title comes from game terminology referring to consistent damage a character in icts over a period of time.</p>
<p>For the exhibition Highlights, Sunwoo Hoon imagined a project for SeMA’s lounge spaces titled The Flat is Political. The work presents new webtoons, representing today’s Korean society and featuring ambiguous images and dialogues. The webtoons deny a linear or chronological narrative; instead they use the existing forms of webtoon narrative style and suggest diverse ways of reading images and dialogues. They also maintain the artist’s signature style: an insightful message contained in the most general stories of our times.</p>
